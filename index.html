    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Currently, I live in Portland, Oregon with my fianc√©, Jaime, and our cat, Ramona. I'm from Arizona, and I've also lived in Sweden, Estonia, and Austria. Jaime is from Chile, so we are a very multicultural household!</p>
    <p>On this page, I'll go into a bit more detail about my background, as well as why I chose to take Introduction to Programming at Epidocus. I'll also go over some of my interests outside of work.</p>
  
    <h2>Background & Motivations</h2>
    <p>By day, I am a <span class="important">Senior Customer Support Advisor at Squarespace</span>, where I work on the New Release Team. I also serve as the <span class="important">Chair for the Women+ at PDX ERG</span>. Previously, I was a <span class="important">Linguistic QA Tester at Welocalize,</span> specializing in Swedish. I studied political science at Northern Arizona University and EU law at University of Graz.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing a career in QA, and I chose to take this course at Epicodus after it was recommended to me by a colleague who works in QA. In taking this course, I hope to develop my understanding and ability to use code, which I will then be able to use for automated testing.</p>
    <p>When I was in middle school and high school, web design was one of my favorite hobbies. I'm excited to pick up coding again and learn more about how to properly format my code, something I definitely didn't do when I was 12, as well as learning more about industry-standard programs.</p>

    <h2>Interests, Hobbies, & Skills</h2>
    <p><strong>Interests:</strong> History, learning Spanish, linguistics, sci fi, British murder mysteries, 90s acoustic music, hot yoga</p>
    <p><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Traveling, thrifting - especially for Polaroid cameras, trying new restaurants, bothering my cat</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Swedish, customer service, project management, mentoring and training, getting lost even though I'm looking at Google Maps</p>
