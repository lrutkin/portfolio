    <h2>Hi, I'm <em>Leslie</em>!</h2>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Currently, I live in Portland, Oregon with my fianc√©, Jaime, and our cat, Ramona.</p>
    <p>When I was in middle school and high school, web design was one of my favorite hobbies. I'm excited to pick up coding again and learn more about how to properly format my code, something I definitely didn't do when I was 12.</p>
  
    <h2>Background & Motivations</h2>
    <p>By day, I am a Senior Customer Support Advisor at Squarespace, where I work on the New Release Team. I also serve as the Chair for the Women+@PDX ERG. Previously, I was a Linguistic QA Tester at Welocalize.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing a career in QA, and I chose to take this course at Epicodus when it was recommended to me by a colleague who works in QA. In taking this course, I hope to develop my understanding and ability to use code.</p>
